# Match 5 in Rust
My match 5 game written in rust. It currently uses a very simple ascii representation of the board, and you have to manually enter the cell index where you want to place a mark, but it will eventually have an ncurses ui, network support, a kickstarter page, a cosmetics store, facebook integration, export to tiktok, only for a $5/month subscription.

# Building and testing
1. Check out the project
2. cargo build
3. cargo test
4. cargo run

I'm still figuring out how to configure github actions to build releases.
